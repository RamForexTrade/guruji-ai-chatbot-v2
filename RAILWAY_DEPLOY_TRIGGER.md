# Force Railway Redeploy

This file is created to trigger Railway redeploy with the latest code changes.

**Latest Fix**: Updated test_groq_connection() to use config model instead of hardcoded decommissioned model.

**Issue**: llama3-8b-8192 has been decommissioned
**Solution**: Now uses llama-3.3-70b-versatile from config.yaml
